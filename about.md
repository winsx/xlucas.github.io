Wow, you've made it to my profile page! Well, I guess you want to know a little
bit more about me ?

So let me introduce myself. My name is Xavier Lucas. I'm a 29 year old French
IT engineer who started its journey back in 2010. I'm currently working as a
Senior DevOps engineer (SRE equivalent) at [OVH][ovh-com] since 2015.

I'm passionate about all sort of things graviting around Information
Technology, always ready to question myself, learn, try and discover.
Intellectual and architectural challenges are my fuel on this journey.
