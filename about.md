My name is Xavier Lucas. I'm a 29 year old French IT engineer who started its
journey back in 2010.

I've been working some years in dev and ops consecutively before joining
[OVH][ovh-com] in 2015. I'm currently a Senior DevOps Engineer working on
Cloud Storage amongst various other things. I love open source, and really
enjoy building, discovering, contributing, improving.

I'm passionate about all sort of things graviting around Information
Technology, always ready to question myself, learn, try and discover.
Intellectual and architectural challenges are my fuel on this journey.

Maybe we will meet soon ?
